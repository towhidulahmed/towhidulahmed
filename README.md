I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast focused on embedded systems security, firmware analysis, and threat intelligence. Currently working on my master's thesis involving automated vulnerability detection in operational technology (OT) devices.

My background includes hands-on experience with reverse engineering, network security analysis, and penetration testing. I enjoy dissecting how things work at the low level—particularly embedded systems and their communication protocols.

## What I'm Working On

**Reverse Engineering & Firmware Analysis**  
Analyzing embedded firmware for ARMv7 architectures using Binwalk and Ghidra, looking for vulnerabilities and insecure implementations in IoT and industrial devices.

**OT/ICS Security**  
Studying communication protocols like 1-Wire and I2C in operational technology systems, understanding how devices communicate and where security gaps exist.

**Threat Intelligence**  
Building skills with MITRE ATT&CK framework, YARA rules, OpenCTI, and MISP to understand threat actor behaviors and improve detection capabilities.

## Research & Academic Work

### Master's Thesis — *April 2025 – Present*
**Automated Detection of Vulnerable Firmware in OT Devices**

Developing a signature-based system to automatically identify known CVEs in unpacked firmware images. This involves reverse engineering binaries to spot insecure implementations and testing the workflow against real industrial firmware to document common vulnerability patterns.

### Research Project — *May 2024 – July 2024*
**Security Analysis of Mechatronic Locking Systems Using the 1-Wire Protocol**

This project involved capturing and decoding communication between electronic keys and locks using a logic analyzer. I built Python tools to parse the protocol, identified weaknesses like static identifiers and predictable checksums, and demonstrated practical replay attacks. The research also explored cryptographic countermeasures through protocol timing analysis.

## Projects

### [1-Wire Protocol Analysis & Attack Demo](https://github.com/towhidulahmed/1wire-decoder-analysis)

Captured embedded communication between an electronic key and lock system, then built a Python decoder to extract and analyze the protocol structure. Identified vulnerabilities in proprietary hardware protocols through bit-level timing analysis. Demonstrated how static identifiers enable forwarding attacks.

### [Bash Scripting Utilities](https://github.com/towhidulahmed/bash_scripting)

Collection of practical Bash scripts for automation and security workflows:
- **password_generator.sh** — Generates cryptographically strong passwords using OpenSSL
- **script_backup.sh** — Automates Git commits and pushes for quick version control

### [Vulnerability Assessment Lab](https://github.com/towhidulahmed/nessus-metasploit-audit)

Performed a comprehensive vulnerability scan on Ubuntu 8.04.x using Nessus, then followed up with Metasploit exploitation. Documented 71 vulnerabilities including critical backdoors and authentication issues. Includes detailed remediation recommendations and exploitability analysis—useful for learning vulnerability management workflows.
